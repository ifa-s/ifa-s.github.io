  <center><h5><i><a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz">Tim Walz</a> is the vice presidential candidate for the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential election, under Democrat candidate Kamala Harris.</i></h5></center>
  <p>The presence of social media in the 2024 presidential election is larger than ever, and its influence will only grow as the years go on. This website intends to serve as an analysis of Walz’s social media campaign, his use of rhetoric and imagery to sell himself as a good vice president, and to answer these core three questions: </p>
  <ol>
<li>How is Walz as an accessory for Harris?
<li>Has Walz contributed positively to the Harris campaign via social media?
<li>Will his viral social media campaign work in 2024?
  </ol>
  <p> It’s important to note that we cannot truly answer these questions until the election results come out. The current polls (as of November 1st, 2024) are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/election-2024-4-days-out/">gridlocked</a>, especially in the key swing states that will determine the 2024 presidential election. This means we can only speculate on the true effectiveness of his campaign until the votes are counted, likely a few days after this assignment is submitted.</p>
