  <center><h5><i><a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz">Tim Walz</a> is the vice presidential candidate for the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential election, under Democrat candidate Kamala Harris.</i></h5></center>
  <p>In this section, I aim to answer the three questions posed in the About section, by looking at Walz’s social media posts: <p>
    <ol>
<li>How is Walz as an accessory for Harris?
<li>Has Walz contributed positively to the Harris campaign?
<li>Does his viral social media campaign work in 2024?
</ol>
<p>First, I want to point out the “boring” posts on his social media profiles:</p>
  <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Venture capitalists like JD Vance moved jobs out of rural communities. Donald Trump is cosplaying as a McDonald&#39;s worker.<a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KamalaHarris</a> and I have actually brought back jobs and stood up for workers – and we have real plans to support rural and manufacturing communities. <a href="https://t.co/1S0DgxJKG9">pic.twitter.com/1S0DgxJKG9</a></p>&mdash; Tim Walz (@Tim_Walz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz/status/1848416154894929930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KamalaHarris</a> and I both lost a parent to cancer.<br><br>It&#39;s the kind of loss that changes your life forever. There&#39;s the time before the cancer – and the time afterward. <br><br>Grief is already painful enough. Families shouldn&#39;t have to suffer financially on top of it all. My mom had to… <a href="https://t.co/T7aibBF3dJ">pic.twitter.com/T7aibBF3dJ</a></p>&mdash; Tim Walz (@Tim_Walz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz/status/1848342510701027759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </div>
<p>These serve as the typical political campaign post: He says a catchy line at the start to catch your attention, then dives further into information with the rest of the text and the videos attached to the posts. While these posts don’t do well in social media traction compared to his other posts, they serve an important purpose by actually informing those who view his social media accounts. This shows how Walz contributes positively to the Harris campaign, by spreading the words and policies that Harris supports to people who follow him but not other politicians’ accounts. </p>
<p>Next, looking at his viral posts:</p>
  <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kamala Harris respects the Constitution and the rule of law.<br><br>Donald Trump does not.</p>&mdash; Tim Walz (@Tim_Walz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz/status/1849465500109049950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you have to say it... <a href="https://t.co/Bc7REf2WbC">https://t.co/Bc7REf2WbC</a></p>&mdash; Tim Walz (@Tim_Walz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz/status/1847122819131343255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    </div>
<p>These are some examples of the more viral posts on Walz’s accounts, showing two aspects of how Walz’s social media campaign has been successful in 2024. The first image shows the viral “weird” campaign which Walz has leaned into heavily, showing another way the Walz campaign has helped Harris: He has the viral, quotable lines in a similar way to Trump in 2016 with catchy chants and phrases that made him viral enough to win the election. This shows further how he has contributed positively to the Harris campaign, being able to mimic the success of Republicans in areas the Democrats have struggled in the last few elections: Viral, relatable imagery. </p>
<p>A more emotionally charged example of a viral post:</p>
  <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donald Trump said “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had.”<br><br>As a 24-year veteran of our military, that makes me sick as hell — and it should make you sick. <a href="https://t.co/vmMJF7RaC5">pic.twitter.com/vmMJF7RaC5</a></p>&mdash; Tim Walz (@Tim_Walz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz/status/1848906211132833861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    </div>
<p>This post is another great example of a viral campaign post, but this time it channels anger, rather than the previous posts of joy or sadness. This shows part of Walz’s work as an accessory for Harris, emphasizing how he is a veteran, making him someone with a strong reason to be angry, as well as making him a more likable figure due to his past in the service. This is a very direct and effective example of how Democrats have been using Trump’s extremism against him (Collinson, 2024), trying to win over those who his quotes may have alienated.</p>
<p>His use of social media to emphasize his contributions to the Harris campaign, as well as his ability to make viral posts and quotes that spread across the internet like wildfire, emphasize the importance of social media in the current presidential election. According to a Pew Research study, 54% of adults say they at least sometimes get news from social media (with those between 18 and 49 making up the largest portion) (Pew Research, 2024b), showing just how important social media is to spread your campaign messages as far out as possible. From this, we can conclude that it is likely that Walz’s viral social media campaigns have made a positive impact on the Harris presidential campaign due to how they emphasize his ability to be a good counterbalance to Harris as a candidate, showing his relatable points and emphasizing his past as a non-politician, as well as their ability to spread their messaging farther due to the mass presence of social media in the modern age. Although we can’t know if it was effective enough to win the presidential election for Kamala Harris until the results are out, it’s clear that the Walz campaign was able to contribute more good than bad to her campaign. </p>
