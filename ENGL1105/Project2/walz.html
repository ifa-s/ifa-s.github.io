  <center><h5><i><a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz">Tim Walz</a> is the vice presidential candidate for the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential election, under Democrat candidate Kamala Harris.</i></h5></center>
  <p>Tim Walz was <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/">born in Nebraska in 1964</a>, where he grew up on a farm in a rural area, a key aspect of his relatable, small-town American personality. Later on, he enrolled in the National Guard in Texas, worked as a teacher in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-china-views/">China</a> and the United States, and moved to Minnesota where he later became governor (Grant, 2024). The important thing to take away from this is that Walz is not a politician. He wasn’t raised in a rich family and didn’t grow up in a large town or city. He went to a small college, he was a soldier and he was a teacher. These are all essential aspects of his current persona and campaign, painting him as an average small-town American who has worked as a public servant his entire life, making him a relatable yet upstanding citizen for rural Americans all over the country (Sonnevend, 2024), something the Democratic party has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/partisanship-in-rural-suburban-and-urban-communities/">historically struggled with</a>. In his political career, Walz has generally <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/politics/minnesota-governor-walz-progressive-policies/index.html">supported progressive policies</a>, a point somewhat contradictory to the average rural American. This is part of what makes him so appealing to younger rural voters, as he is a relatable figure (unlike career politicians), but still supports the progressive policies generally favored by young people today (Bennett, 2024). </p>
