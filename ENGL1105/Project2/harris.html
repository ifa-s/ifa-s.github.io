  <p>To looker deeper into how Walz has helped Harris’s campaign, it’s important to first understand the strategies used in the 2024 Harris campaign that led to her being as popular as she is today. She’s primarily gone about this in three ways: Leaning into the fight for bodily autonomy, viral social media posts, and attacking republican policies and personalities. </p>
<p> The fight for bodily autonomy is the most orthodox of her campaign strategies, heavily emphasizing a point that strikes a sore spot for millions of Americans: the right for women to have an abortion (Chávez, 2024). There aren’t many statements to make about this topic. A study from Pew Research shows that “About six-in-ten (63%) [Americans] say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.” (Pew Research, 2024a). This means that Harris will simply gain more supporters due to supporting an emotionally charged issue, with most Americans on her side. Walz has also used this strategy in his debate with JD Vance, to great success (Bidgood, 2024). </p>

<p> Viral social media posts and attacking republican policies and personalities go hand-in-hand, with the primary example being the “weird” campaign that went viral earlier this year. Both parts are new strategies the Democrats have been perfecting in recent years - a way to match the virality that some claim <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/11/donald-trump-won-because-of-facebook.html">won Trump the 2016 presidential election</a>. Harris going on talk shows, trying to appear more relatable in public appearances, and posting on social media like TikTok and X/Twitter are all aspects of this campaign, and attacking republican politicians is a core of what makes some of these posts go viral. In the aforementioned “weird” campaign, championed by Walz, the core of it was incredibly simple: the fact that Republicans care so much about what you do in the privacy of your own home is weird. This was a message that many people resonated with (McCausland, 2024), but some were bothered by how it felt like Democrats were stooping to the level of the Republican party, especially <a href="https://rsf.org/en/usa-trump-verbally-attacked-media-more-100-times-run-election">Donald Trump</a> (Friedman, 2024). This represents the direction the Democratic party seems to be moving towards, trying to match the energy coming from the Republican party to win over the voters who prefer progressive policies, but prefer the refreshing idea of having your political figures not be career politicians. </p>
