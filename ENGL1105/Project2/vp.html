  <center><h5><i><a href="https://x.com/Tim_Walz">Tim Walz</a> is the vice presidential candidate for the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential election, under Democrat candidate Kamala Harris.</i></h5></center>
<p> The vice president is a role that simultaneously holds a lot of power, being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tie-breaking_votes_cast_by_the_vice_president_of_the_United_States">able to break ties in Congress</a> and directly influence the current president, and yet doesn’t hold much power outside of what’s delegated to them by the current president (Schmitt, 2022). A major part of the power a vice president holds is before the president gets elected, stemming from the influence they hold on the election by serving as a good accessory for the vice president. Accessory refers to how the vice president looks next to the president, how their image complements and contrasts the imagery of the president, and how their words support and reinforce the words of the president, but to a different audience. </p>

<p>A great example of this in the past is from the 2008 presidential campaign, with the way Joe Biden was used as an accessory for the Obama campaign. In a lot of ways, Joe Biden and Obama were incredibly different. Obama was a young progressive candidate from Hawaii, serving as a beacon of the progressive movement by being the first black president, the first president born out of the continental US, and the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/youngest-us-president/">fifth youngest president in US history</a>. While this list represents a refreshing change of pace for some, it serves to alienate others, making the appearance of the vice president incredibly important (Bush, 2024). Biden was an older career politician from the East Coast, serving as the stereotypical image of a democratic candidate in recent years: an old upper-class white guy. Those who supported the previous few presidents would find him a familiar figure, the spitting image of your average American politician. This directly correlates to the current presidential race: Harris is a black woman, both minority groups underrepresented in American politics, and she’s a career politician from the West Coast, traits that may alienate mid-western and rural voters or those who are tired of having career politicians as candidates. Next to her stands Walz, a civil servant from the rural midwest, an older white man who fits the status quo regarding identity, making him a relatable figure for the midwesterners who may feel alienated by having a progressive candidate from California (Armstrong, 2024). </p>
