  <p><a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/album/the-nine-thousandth-pair-of-eyes"><i>The Nine Thousandth Pair of Eyes</i></a> is an indie rock/post-punk album by <i>Muzzy Mum</i> (Chinese: 麻茲媽, Pinyin: mázīmā), released on June 25th, 2024, under the label <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/">Maybe Mars</a>. Chinese indie rock is a genre that grew in a very unique way, as it could not have formed until the influx of Western influences after the cultural revolution (Field). Due to the taboo of being a genre with little Chinese history, and the grungy, punk nature of indie rock as a genre, the early 2000s indie rock boom in China was primarily due to popularity with youth, especially those dissatisfied with their government, viewing the dream of becoming a rock artist as an alternative to the typical life path of going through school and finding a job (Field). This edginess is a major part of what has led Chinese indie rock to have a large anti-government, anti-censorship, and generally depressing view of life in modern Chinese cities.</p>
  <p><i>Maybe Mars</i> is a music label that has supported the indie rock scene since its foundation. Publishing albums for legendary bands like <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/album/carsick-cars">Carsick Cars</a>, <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/album/birdstriking">Birdstriking</a>, and <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/album/city-weather-sailing">P.K.14</a>, they have never been scared to challenge government censorship and provide voices to the youth of the Chinese indie rock scene. Formed in 2007 by Michael Pettis, Maybe Mars remained the leading music label to promote Chinese indie rock ever since. They have worked hard to get Chinese music taken seriously (china-underground), and their support can not be understated in making Chinese indie rock the scene it is today, not just in size but also braving the potentially dangerous political environment that many bands all but outright speak against in their music.</p>

  <p>Muzzy Mum is one of the newer bands with the label, and they stand on the shoulders of giants. Their droning music style and anti-government imagery are reminiscent of Carsick Cars, one of the largest bands to come out of Chinese indie rock. These callbacks, as well as being signed with the leading music label in the scene, create an effective appeal to ethos for anyone looking for some new indie rock in the typical style of Maybe Mars, or with a sound similar to Carsick Cars. </p>
  <p>It's also essential to understand how government surveillance is used in China, and why it may strike a nerve with some people, especially youth. As a disclaimer, this is a topic rife with misinformation and disinformation, as both the Chinese and American governments lie about the state of government surveillance in China. An example of this is the recent manufactured crisis of the Chinese "spy balloon" found in the US, which was claimed by the president to have "two freight cars' worth of spying equipment", was later assessed to likely have no intelligence collection at all by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff (Martin). Despite the disinformation surrounding the topic, China indeed has a very vast surveillance and information networks. It's important to note that, while Americans generally value privacy highly, as do many Chinese people, it's recently been viewed as a trade, exchanging privacy for "more precise governance", to make life easier and more convenient for Chinese citizens.
