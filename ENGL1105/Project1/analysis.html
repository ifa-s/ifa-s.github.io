  <h1>Cover Analysis of <i>The Nine Thousandth Pair of Eyes</i></h1>

  <p><a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/album/the-nine-thousandth-pair-of-eyes"><i>The Nine Thousandth Pair of Eyes</i></a> is an indie rock/post-punk album by <i>Muzzy Mum</i> (Chinese: 麻茲媽, Pinyin: mázīmā), released on June 25th, 2024, under the label <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/">Maybe Mars</a>.</p>

  <p>Looking into the rhetorical methods used in this album cover, it's clear that this cover was not intended to be use as an advertisement in the traditional sense. Many album covers use words, like the <a href="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2606939120_16.jpg">name of the band</a> or <a href="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3214132322_16.jpg">title of the album</a> to give viewers an idea of what the album may be like and attempt to get them to listen to it using ethos. The cover of "The Nine Thousandth Pair of Eyes" goes the opposite direction, and it serves a purpose closer to a piece you would see in an art gallery, with the seemingly painted medium furthering this notion. The cover of this album is used to spread a statement using pathos, rather than as an aggressive advertisement like many covers. This can be contrasted even with other album covers from bands who try to spread an anti-government statement. A famous example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Los_Angeles_(album)">"The Battle of Los Angeles"</a> by Rage Against The Machine, an American rap metal band which focuses heavily on political topics. Even in "The Battle of Los Angeles", a cover with the haunting outline of a protester in black spray paint, they paint their band name in large letters across the top of the cover. On the other hand, Muzzy Mum doesn't attempt to link the cover to their band, and the only way you can tell it's the cover of an album is the square aspect ratio.</p>

  <p>Even though the cover is not meant as a traditional advertisement, doesn't mean that it's not an advertisement at all. This serves as the perfect advertisement for their intended audience because of how depressing and offputting it is to most audiences. The intended audience for this album is the <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/17/chinas-defeated-youth">dissatisfied and disillusioned youth of cities in China</a>, and they would be attracted to the imagery with the same sentiment. This also uses ethos in a roundabout way, as people who liked the cover of Carsick Cars’ second album may find the eyeball motif reminiscent, or anyone who liked the painting motif in other Maybe Mars releases. Due to this cover being appealing to some, but overall offputting for the masses, this ends up being a very effective advertisement within the limited audience that they intend to hit, in the form of the urban youth.</p>
  <p>Despite being able to attract the intended audience and ward off unintended audiences, it's clear that this cover is only successful depending on how you measure success. While the imagery on the cover gives you the intended uncomfortable feeling, that still may ward off those who would still like the music, even if they don't sympathize with the opinions of the band. Measuring the success of their album with streams and listens makes it seem like a failure, with their two demos having less than a thousand streams on Douban (the largest music social media service in China), and their Spotify only having 33 monthly listeners. Despite this, I don't think the goal of the album is commercial success. While there are no primary sources I can find on the English internet (and where I can search on the Chinese internet), I think it's clear from the lack of advertising and the offputting-at-best cover that Muzzy Mum did not have commercial success as the primary goal of this album. This is confirmed further when considering that the themes of the album would likely have them <a href="https://jakenewby.substack.com/p/banned-in-china-on-tour-in-japan">put in danger</a> if the album did take off. More than anything, this album is a homage to P.K.14 and Carsick Cars, with a similar music style and themes, and it's a way for the artists to express their complaints with urban life in China, which in itself is a homage to the roots of the genre. Measuring their success in ways of artistic expression and nostalgia for the legends of the Chinese indie rock scene, I would say this album cover succeeds in those goals.</p>
