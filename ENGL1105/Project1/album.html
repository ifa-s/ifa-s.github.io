  <p><a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/album/the-nine-thousandth-pair-of-eyes"><i>The Nine Thousandth Pair of Eyes</i></a> is an indie rock/post-punk album by <i>Muzzy Mum</i> (Chinese: 麻茲媽, Pinyin: mázīmā), released on June 25th, 2024, under the label <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/">Maybe Mars</a>.</p>
  <p>This is the second full-length album from Muzzy Mum, and it continues the themes of dissatisfaction with urban life from the first one. Lyrics like "Villages and farmlands are forced to slowly disappear into the night / Yet they don’t seem to care at all." (from the song <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/track/genetic-food-and-humanistic-care">Genetic Food and Humanistic Care</a>) describe the disappointment of how villages are abandoned in favor of/turned into cities. Other lyrics like "Walking has become dangerous / Language has become dangerous / Everything is dangerous." (from the song <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/track/white-house">White House</a>) directly lament the modern landscape of censorship in surveillance in China.</p>
  <p>These lamentations do not always make it past censors, with multiple of the songs on their current album not being available in mainland China due to the themes discussed in the lyrics. They use these lyrics to appeal to the emotion of the listener, with long droning verses of repeated lyrics creating an unsettling feeling, provoking the listener with pathos to make them feel negative about the topics discussed. This is quite effective when combined with the dreary imagery of the cover.</p>
  <p>An important difference to note between Muzzy Mum and their primary influences (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.K._14">P.K.14</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsick_Cars">Carsick Cars</a>) is that their lyrics are significantly more direct and to the point (Newby). While past bands in the scene may dance around a topic, creating metaphorical lyrics that can be interpreted in many ways, and could go over the heads of some, Muzzy Mum directly states exactly what they are trying to communicate. Even their titles, such as "<a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/track/lets-get-used-to-stopping-the-discussion">Let's Get Used to Stopping the Discussion</a>", are often direct and to the point, which can be seen as a way of rebelling against Chinese censorship, extending the themes from their lyrics to how they present themselves as a band.</p>
