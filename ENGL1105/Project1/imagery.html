  <p>To determine how effective the imagery used in the cover is, it's important to get a baseline of the visual rhetoric used within the cover, determined by ethos, pathos, logos, and kairos. Logos is the easiest one to address, as there is no attempt at appealing to logos on the cover. There are no words or obvious visual statements on the cover that can be seen as appealing to facts or logic. Ethos is similar, as ethos is used within the sound of the album (being very reminiscent of <a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/album/you-can-listen-you-can-talk">Carsick Cars' second album</a>) and the name of the label, but neither of these are brought up in the actual visuals of the cover. This means that pathos and kairos make up the imagery in the cover, and these two rhetorical appeals are used in tandem. The increase in online and offline government surveillance in China with new developments in technology has led to distrust towards government surveillance with urban youth (McNeill), making the pathos appeals in the cover more effective due to what has been happening with the Chinese government since the inception of the internet (kairos).</p>

  <p>In terms of visual elements on the album, the major motif is the use of eyes in the photo, located on the TV and the wall. While the eye on the unplugged TV seems to be watching the sitting man in the prison cell, the eye on the wall at the bottom of the cover appears to be watching the viewer, creating this uncomfortable feeling of being watched. Combined with the dreary colors, this unsettling feeling is a perfect use of pathos. First, the imagery of the man stuck in the prison cell being watched may provoke negative feeling regarding surveillance, the goal of the album. Second, the imagery of the cover watching you look at the painting creates an almost "meta" imagery that reflects the current Chinese internet, using kairos. An eye (the government) is watching you as you look at the cover of the album. This imagery can be incredibly effective for those who already hold a distrust towards their government or government surveillance, and it can cause people to consider the idea of surveillance that have not before, making it a strong use of both pathos and kairos.</p>
  <p>Their effective use of pathos continues with the imagery of bars on the windows, creating the imagery of the man in the chair being in prison, with the man holding the TV watching over him. This can viewed as an allegory for living in a <a href="https://madeinchinajournal.com/2023/11/13/surveillance-state-a-conversation-with-josh-chin/">surveillance state</a>: the man in the chair is stuck in the state, unable to leave his cell. The man holding the TV has unplugged it from the wall, which can be viewed as taking away the content that was already on the TV and replacing it with his media, represented by the eye in the TV. This mirrors the modern internet landscape in China, where controversial media is often hidden or replaced, with those who talk about it or search for it being watched. The most notorious example of this is the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Tiananmen-Square-incident">Tiananmen Square protest</a>, which is directly addressed in the album with the song titled "<a href="https://maybemars.bandcamp.com/track/aunties-square-invasion-plan">Auntie's Square Invasion Plan</a>", with the lyrics (translated) "Three years of lies, / Accompanied by new anxiety sufferers. / The real world, / Reflected on the walls of the public restroom in the street / Happy smiles, / Appear punctually in the evening weather report." addressing this topic by saying the real world is "reflected on the walls of the public restroom on the street", which cannot be monitored and censored by the government, whereas the lies and smiles on the news are a result of that censorship. This directly references how the Tianment Square Protest was not covered on Chinese news and continues to be censored to this day (“China: Account for Tiananmen Massacre”).</p>
