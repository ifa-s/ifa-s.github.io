  <center><h5><i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway</i> is a 2021 film in the Gundam franchise, the first in a trilogy of movies, the rest of which are unreleased. It’s based on the 1989 novel, <i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway’s Flash.</i></h5></center>

  <p><i>Mobile Suit Gundam</i> (hereby referred to as Gundam) is a franchise that started in 1979 with the Japanese release of the animated TV show with the same name. Gundam shows and movies contain a variety of series and genres, but they all have one core aspect: <b>Mobile suits</b>, or the giant mechanical robots that the franchise is known for, popularizing the idea of “Mecha” as a genre in the 80s and 90s. These mobile suits play a significant role in each of the shows, typically being used for war between nations, with the major timeline detailing a war between the Earth Federation (those who remain on Earth decades in the future) and Zeon (an extremist group formed by some of the humans that move to space, or Spacenoids). This war is kicked off with Zeon attacking a space colony, and the protagonist of the original show, Amuro Ray, finds a prototype mobile suit, called the RX-78-2 Gundam. This mobile suit is the most famous across the history of the franchise, and future designs that are known as Gundams are all based on this iconic robot. The timeline of the original show is known as Universal Century, and it’s considered the main “canon” as compared to the spinoff shows released after it.</p>

  <p><i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway</i> takes place in the Universal Century timeline, serving as the sequel to <i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Char’s Counterattack</i>, the original capstone film of the original three TV shows from the 80s. It’s important to recognize how long-lasting the franchise is overall, as this film will generally feel out of place unless you have seen the three 50-episode TV shows from the 80s as well as the preceding film before watching. For example, the main character Hathaway Noa is the son of Bright Noa, the original captain of the crew in the 1979 TV series. The film makes reference to the original antagonist of the franchise, Char, failing to drop an asteroid onto Earth, and how Hathaway Noa seems to be trying to replicate some of Char’s actions (namely, somewhat misguided environmental terrorism). The fact that the creators in the film chose to have little to no background information baked into the film makes it clear that this movie was not primarily intended to gather new audiences: Instead, they wanted to provide a sufficient sequel and accurately adapt the 1989 novel it’s based off of, focusing on dedication to the franchise rather than gathering a new fanbase off of the film.</p>
