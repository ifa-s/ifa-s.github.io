  <center><h5><i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway</i> is a 2021 film in the Gundam franchise, the first in a trilogy of movies, the rest of which are unreleased. It’s based on the 1989 novel, <i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway’s Flash.</i></h5></center>
  <p><i>Hathaway</i> takes place in UC 105, 26 years after the events in the original 1979 show. During that time, the original antagonist Char is presumed dead, but his ideals live on in Hathaway Noa (anonymously “Mafty Navue Erin”), leader of the terrorist group Mafty which aims to force all remaining on Earth to move to space colonies. In the film, Hathaway struggles between being Mafty Navue Erin and being the son of a soldier, Hathaway Noa. While the end of this movie doesn't provide a definitive answer to what he views himself as (it is the first of a trilogy, after all), along the way he meets a large cast of characters on both sides of the war and fights in the front lines on the side of Mafty. Throughout the film, there are many aspects I connect with, but I want to emphasize the most important two: The world, and the mobile suits.</p>

  <p>Gundam is a franchise that has historically struggled with environments and stories. Many of the most popular entries to the Gundam franchise are very basic, following a simple template (often extracted from the original show), with the story and backgrounds serving as a vehicle to feed you new mobile suit designs, and to let you watch them fight. While there is nothing wrong with this, and I am guilty of loving many of these bad shows, it makes the well-animated environments of Hathaway stand out even more than they already do. Watch the video clips below:</p>
  <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%"><iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/w31pip?" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
  <br>
  <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%"><iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/xwoehj?" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
  <p>These clips are excellent displays of how there is a living environment in the film. There are living characters and a thriving city outside of being a plot device and background for the mobile suits to fight in. Contrasted with the low-quality environments seen in previous entries, with barren deserts and cities laid out like mobile suit fight arenas (or even just the background of the stars for episodes at a time), these environments are seriously impressive. This is a major reason why this movie connects with me so strongly: The environments and characters feel alive. It reminds me strongly of strolling to unknown areas of cities I’ve traveled to in the past, something I hold fond memories of. Ever since watching the film, I’ve wanted to walk the streets of Davao in UC109 or take a flight through space in the Haunzen. On the other hand, while Neo Hong Kong was a cool environment in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam (1985), the city served as nothing but an area for robots to stomp around in, with simple foil characters that advanced the plot for the crew members. Similarly to the comforting environments, the small details in how characters are animated are very visually pleasing, with the small flourishes providing a similar comfortable feeling to the detailed environments, making the setting of the film feel even more real. </p>

  <p>While the environments are essential to making this movie my personal favorite, they can hardly hold a candle to the main attraction: the mobile suits. These 23-to-26-meter chunks of metal are seriously well-designed, with legendary designers like Kimitoshi Yamane, Seiichi Nakatani, and (my favorite mecha designer ever) Hajime Katoki taking on roles for the project. The prolific work of Yamane and Nakatani designed some of the most iconic mobile suits in the film, the Penelope and Xi Gundam, and Katoki added his charm by making the mobile suits have a more gritty and realistic feel to them, overall making the mobile suits feel very suited to the environment they are displayed in. It cannot be overstated how these designers, combined with the amazing CGI team working on the film, impacted the feeling of the film by having gritty and realistic, but still spectacle-worthy, mobile suits that fit like a jigsaw puzzle in the beautifully rendered environments. Watch this iconic fight sequence from the end of the film:</p>
  <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%"><iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/ac594w?" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
  <p>This is one of my favorite fight scenes in all of Gundam, especially as someone who has built both the HG Penelope and Xi Gundam. In this scene you can see the mobile suits clash against each other, swiftly maneuvering through space to deliver every gimmick contained in the mobile suits. And while neither of those mobile suits is my favorite in terms of visuals or build experience (both of those awards go to the PG Unicorn (image)), the quality of the animation in the fight, and the memories of sitting in my attic, clipping away at a model kit for these very robots, makes this one of my favorite fight scenes. You can see how the joints of the robots move, how they swing their swords and raise their weapons, and it’s just a spectacle to watch thanks to the quality animation of the film. Similarly, watch these more grounded scenes, showing the sense of scale:</p>
  <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%"><iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/5xkl86?" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
  <br>
  <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%"><iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/0l6m9t?" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
  <p>The above scenes do a much better job of giving a sense of scale, with the contrast between the mobile suits and the buildings or people around them giving a more terrifying reality of mobile suits: The idea of your home or city being crushed by one of these hulking robots is a haunting one, and one that fulfills the fantasy of piloting one of these massive robots. The shots from the cockpit of the machine also feed into this idea, with the full 360-degree screen and control system feeling futuristic, yet not nearly impossible. The way these mobile suits are depicted in their environment, with elements that are science fiction yet not outlandish, as well as having the experience of building them myself (in the simplified form of Gunpla kits), makes the franchise feel more like a living, breathing world than ever before. While the sense of scale may be terrifying to think about, it also feels comforting to see my favorite science fiction displayed in such an “alive” manner. </p>
  <p>This sense of comfort perfectly displays why I love Hathaway: it loves Gundam just as much as I do. They didn’t heavily cater to new audiences by overloading the film with backstories from other installments, and it respects the franchise’s legacy and focuses on creating the best adaptation of the novel possible. With vibrant environments and accurate mobile suits, Hathaway delivers everything I could hope for as someone who has poured countless hours into building Gunpla and watching Gundam.</p>
