  <center><h5><i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway</i> is a 2021 film in the Gundam franchise, the first in a trilogy of movies, the rest of which are unreleased. It’s based on the 1989 novel, <i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway’s Flash.</i></h5></center>
<p>Gunpla is a contraction of a contraction, coming from Gundam Plamo, which comes from Gundam Plastic Model, referring to the hobby plastic model kits created by Bandai Namco to create merchandise from the iconic designs of Gundam. Plastic model kits have existed for almost a century (“The Historical Journey of Model Kits”), primarily focused on military models such as model planes and model tanks. Gunpla has a core difference to military models, with Gundam models being more marketable as they can pull from the popular TV shows and books to design the model kits. Gunpla also has the key difference of having colored plastic, rather than a primable gray or beige plastic. While this change seems small, it allows for the models to be a great introduction to model kits as a hobby, as you no longer need expensive airbrushes and an array of paints to be able to have a nice-looking shelf piece. They are also designed to avoid using glue or screws, something other major model kit producers often require. Instead, a pair of nippers (or even scissors or nail clippers) and the easy-to-follow, image-based instructions (similar to an IKEA manual) allow you to have a good-looking model in just a few hours. These kits are even more accessible when you consider that they can go as cheap as under twenty USD, making them have a low barrier to entry financially. Despite many of their model kits come with a cheap price, their flagship high-grade (HG) 1/144 scale model kits still generally have a very high-quality standard. If you want to move into something more advanced, they also sell 1/100 Master Grade (MG) and 1/60 Perfect Grade (PG) kits, each model line being larger and more detailed than the last, with an appropriate price increase with each tier. This push for accessibility has paid off, with over 760 million official Gunpla kits being sold between 1980 and 2023 (Bandai Namco). </p>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people got into Gunpla as a hobby due to the relaxing nature of building these kits, similar to the appeal of LEGO (which had a similar hobby boom from 2020-2022). This was around the time I got into the Gunpla hobby, relieving pandemic stress by aggressively building as many kits as I could during the pandemic, supplemented by having a local game store with an amazing stock. I still have fond memories of sitting in my hot attic with the fan on, with my new pair of godhands building amazing kits such as the HG Calibarn, MG Sazabi, and PG Unicorn. Once I started watching the shows from the franchise, it became clear how important mech design is to the franchise as a whole. A good show with boring robots didn’t make me want to go out and buy a kit, but a bad show with pretty robot designs still makes me immediately excited to go build one, even to this day. This is another aspect of how Gundam connects with me as a franchise, as seeing a model you have built fight in its full glory is very entertaining, especially when you can see all of the gimmicks built into the mobile suit in animated form.</p>
